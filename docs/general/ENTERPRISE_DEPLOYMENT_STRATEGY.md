# Enterprise Deployment Strategy

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This document outlines the enterprise-grade deployment strategy addressing:
- Branch-based environment management
- Secure pipeline triggering
- Service-specific deployments
- Environment-specific resource naming

## 🌿 Branch Strategy & Environment Mapping

### Branch-to-Environment Mapping
```
main branch      → production environment    (prod)
develop branch   → staging environment      (staging)  
feature/* branch → development environment  (dev)
hotfix/* branch  → hotfix environment       (hotfix)
```

### Environment-Specific Resource Naming
```
Production:   mono-repo-prod-user-service
Staging:      mono-repo-staging-user-service  
Development:  mono-repo-dev-user-service
Hotfix:       mono-repo-hotfix-user-service
```

## 🔐 Security-First Deployment Approach

### GitHub Actions Scope (Safe Operations)
- ✅ Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- ✅ Unit testing and coverage reports
- ✅ Security scanning (SAST, dependency checks)
- ✅ Build validation (compile/build without deploy)
- ✅ Documentation generation
- ✅ Notification to external systems

### Cloud-Native Pipeline Scope (Deployment Operations)
- 🔒 **GCP Cloud Build** - Triggered by Cloud Build triggers
- 🔒 **AWS CodePipeline** - Triggered by CodeCommit/S3 events
- 🔒 **Manual Triggers** - Via cloud console or CLI with proper IAM

## 🎯 Service-Specific Pipeline Triggering

### File Change Detection Strategy

#### Option 1: Cloud Build Triggers with Path Filters
```yaml
# GCP Cloud Build Trigger Configuration
includedFiles:
  - "backend/services/user_service/**"
  - "shared/common/**"
ignoredFiles:
  - "**/*.md"
  - "**/test_*.py"
```

#### Option 2: Monorepo Change Detection Script
```bash
# Detect changed services between commits
CHANGED_SERVICES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -E "backend/services/[^/]+" | cut -d'/' -f3 | sort -u)
```

#### Option 3: GitHub Actions with External Trigger
```yaml
# GitHub Actions triggers external pipelines via webhooks/APIs
- name: Trigger Cloud Build
  run: |
    curl -X POST "https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT/triggers/$TRIGGER_ID:run" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Secure GitHub Actions (Testing Only)
### Phase 2: Cloud-Native Deployment Pipelines  
### Phase 3: Service Change Detection
### Phase 4: Environment-Specific Deployments
